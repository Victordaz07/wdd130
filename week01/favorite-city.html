            Santo Domingo is my favorite city because it feels both historic and alive. It is the capital of the
            Dominican Republic
            and the heart of my country culture. I love walking through the Colonial Zone and visiting the Santo
            Domingo Temple,
            which reminds me of peace and faith in the middle of a busy city. The people, the food, and the ocean breeze
            make this
            city truly special to me.
