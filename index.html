                The Dominican Republic is my homeland—beautiful beaches, mountains, hardworking people, and a culture
                rooted in faith
                and family. Although I currently live in California, I always carry my country in my heart. Much of what
                I do—studying,
                working, and creating projects—is to honor my roots and build a better future for my family.

            <p>
                Hello! My name is Victor Ruiz. I am originally from the Dominican Republic and now
                live in California with my family. I am a husband, father, disciple of Jesus Christ,
                and a student of BYU Pathway studying Web Development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have several years of experience working in logistics and warehouse operations,
                managing inventories, audits, and process improvement. Now I am focusing on
                technology — especially web development and data analysis — so I can work remotely,
                build useful tools for my community, and provide more stability for my family.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy learning, creating apps and websites, studying doctrine, and finding simple
                ways to solve real problems. This site is part of my progress in the WDD 130 course,
                and I hope you can see my growth as I complete each project.
            </p>
